        "Excellent concept. I liked how the chapter Tenali Raman was done in class 3 but there is no uniformity .. example the speaker option is not available for all chapters. If we provide similar options in all chapters and all subjects students will know what to look for and not guess. If that change can be made along with checking the size of font (some places especially exercises it overlapped causing challenge to read). Kindly upgrade it and it will be a boon for all the students.",
        "I've tried this app but there are so many issues I can't find every chapter, they only teach 2/3 pages of a lesson . That's bad and some lessons are not available . But I like the quiz by the way whatever u should update the app and put more efforts here so we can read everything properly then . And we don't have to face any problem then! Then please do one shot of all the chapters of all subjects. That's what we all need! And I'm not finding some chapters from some subjects so that's all.",
        "This app is very good. It has very good contents. This app has very less features like it has not the feature for playing video in which quality we want. It had drained my half of daily internet in just an hour. Also it has not the feature of video speed. When we have to go back, on watching video, we go back about 30-40 seconds, the video stuck and to watch it we have to start it again. The selecting speed is very slow. Overall this app is veri nice and needs some improvement.",
        "The UI is bad, while I was attempting a quiz, I couldn't scroll down to reveal full question. This really irritated me and I wasn't able to do well. Also when I was logging-in into the app, there was a akward-looking text-overlay, which affected my experience throughout. Also, after completing a course, no matter how I tried, I wasn't able to download a completion certificate. Please fix these issues, I expect really great. Hope you succeed in making this App really great.",
        "This app has a lot of content to explore! Yes it takes time to find the content, even if it's there it wastes a lot of time! I hope diksha will become more organized and easy to use! You can separate all the things that look same for particular classes from your own AI so that we can find the content in the library or from the search bar as soon as possible!"
