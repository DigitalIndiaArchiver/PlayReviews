        "Works well. Would be nicer if it is able to open without network if previously synchronised, otherwise be prepared to go to the back of the line. Desired features: boarding gate and time information, integration with luggage tag information. Remember to have enough charge in the phone.",
        "App is good, it makes the airport struggle easy and i do agree that time is saved. But I just have two concerns that lost 1 star. 1. Doesn't support dark mode well. Difficult to read details in the dark mode 2. Once the barcode is scanned i get all the details of my ticket EXCEPT the gate number which is really disappointing. If possible they should also include the feature of live status of gate number. As all the airports are now becoming silent airport this could really help. Ty.",
        "It's one of the worst apps I ve ever seen. Keeps on hanging, in the rare cases that it works, it will not allow you to attach your identification credentials. Keeps asking for downloaded e-aadhar but doesn't accept it when uploaded. Click to copy OTP and the entire webpage disappears. Honestly don't bother using this, manual checking is faster, much more efficient and definitely easy of mental burden",
        "While the premise is exciting, the execution of this system is very disappointing. During one instance of travel, the app refused to share an OTP with me multiple times during the morning of my flight, and then sent them only after I had already boarded my flight (in the afternoon). In another instance, it accepted all the data and communicated it to the airport - but the machines at the airport did not work. So much needs to be improved.",
        "Badly designed. What does sharing mean? What are the controls at the bottom of the screen when uploading images mean? Concepts that a user must know to use the app are not clear. App is buggy and frequently doesn't work as expected. UI is unpolished, error messages are unhelpful. Overall, this looks like a college student project, rather than a crucial, population-scale utility."
