        "App is designed well, things are easy to find, however, Jeevan Praman just shows an error after face recognition or finger scan, and it stops there. The text is jumbled on the popup and everyday it's the same story. Last year it was working fine, now it's wasted effort. It could be a server error but it's there from many days.",
        "This app really has a lot of potential but what ever feature we choose, it crashes and pop up message \" something went wrong\" comes. Why an app developed by the government is so buggy and useless, we don't understand. I tried nearly 50-60 times for doing basic things in the app but everytime same pop up message comes. Update: Even today I tried in app and also in laptop, it is not loading or showing \" something went wrong\" Such a pathetic app! Last week I sent mail but no response yet",
        "Such a necessary application get it doesn't function most of the times. 8/10 times that I switch it on, it crashes and automatically switches off. Other times, the OTP doesn't generate for so long. Pages keep refreshing and logging me out automatically while I'm in the application. This application works just like \"sarkaari offices\", totally unreliable. Please just fix these bugs, they've been continuing for over a year now.",
        "I guess bad connectivity caused the app to crash on opening the first time. The overall interface is quite good and user friendly. However, some of the internal menus need to be updated properly. The auto-detection of OTP does not happen most of the time. I use Truecaller, so I am unsure if that's the issue. Claim process needs to be more guided and intuitive. Response by developers is almost blazing fast! \ud83d\udc4d",
        "I think it's bad connectivity because there are lots of bugs and fixes. Lot of times when we open the app it's fine but if when we open other thing in the app so it shows, Department servers are too busy or too load. Try after sometime and it shows for a long time like 3-4 days. After that we can open. I think it needs to upgrade more. Otherwise OTP services are too fast \ud83e\udd1e. Thanks"
