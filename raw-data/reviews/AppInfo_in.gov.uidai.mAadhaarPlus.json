        "Useless. Whatever you attempt at doing, single message... Something went wrong, try after sometime.... Only thing wrong with this service obviously is the App. itself. Uninstalled. They have to get some real professional help... not the traditional 'kaam chalu' type, if they really want to make this app. effective, user friendly, purposeful.... maybe redesign the interface and the works....",
        "Very buggy app. When unlocking biometric, it says, this user is registered to another device (I have one device only). Getting OTP is a luck - sometimes, unknown error occurred try again, or it maybe another error message about OTP store, or sometimes the app doesn't open at all. Captcha fails to load on many occasions. Biometric status shows locked on the app while it reports unlocked on the site !. Only on rare occasions has the app performed without a hitch, or at least reasonably well.",
        "hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an issue I've been experiencing with the application you developed, maadhar. Unfortunately, I have encountered several crashes while using the application on my various Redmi devices, and I believe it's important to address these issues to ensure a smoother user experience.",
        "App was stopping all the time. Often showed up technical error message while trying to put OTP. Sometimes, OTPs did not even come, despite doing everything correctly. Gave a * rating few days ago. Then, suddenly the App started to work perfectly after another re-install. Now crashing again. Re-installed it twice. No result. Very frustrating. Changing back to * rating.",
        "Worst piece of software ever. Why advertise the app so much if you can't resolve simplest of bugs. - For convenience if we plan on adding multiple profiles of my family, the app simply states that the profile is registered with another mobile device. - Then there is error about backend server not reachable. - Lock/unlock process is a nightmare on its own. - not just the app, the website is filled with bugs. - a simple language selection doesn't work for some notifications on website."
